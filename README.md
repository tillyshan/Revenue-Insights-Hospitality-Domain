## Business Problem
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
